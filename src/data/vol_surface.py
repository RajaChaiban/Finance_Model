"""Build a QuantLib ``BlackVarianceSurface`` from an :class:`IVGrid`.

The grid carries the *raw* market surface — IVs inverted from listed mids
with NaN holes wherever a quote refused to invert. QuantLib's surface
constructor needs a complete strikes × expiries matrix, so this module
fills NaN cells by linear-in-strike interpolation along each expiry.

Sampling for closed-form pricers
--------------------------------

The hand-coded closed-form engines (``black_scholes.price_european``,
``knockout.price_knockout`` Reiner-Rubinstein) take a *scalar* σ — they
cannot consume a surface object directly. :func:`sample_sigma_for_closed_form`
evaluates the surface at the (K, T) point most relevant to the contract:

  * European → σ at strike (vanilla payoff is determined at K).
  * Knockout → ``max(σ at strike, σ at barrier)``. A single scalar fed
    into Reiner-Rubinstein has two competing effects: it raises the
    vanilla call/put value (good for the holder) AND raises knock-out
    probability (bad for the holder). On a down-and-out put with the
    barrier sitting on the steep put-wing of the smile, σ at barrier is
    materially higher than σ at strike, and the no-arb dominant side is
    that wing — so picking the larger σ keeps the bridge directionally
    on the right side of the surface effect.

    **This is a heuristic.** A single σ cannot separate the smile's
    effect on payoff value from its effect on breach probability — only
    a local-volatility PDE can. The QL ``AnalyticBarrierEngine`` is
    flat-vol by mathematical construction; getting the directional
    answer right under a steep smile requires routing KO products
    through ``FdBlackScholesBarrierEngine`` with
    ``ql.LocalVolSurface`` (Dupire). Tracked as Phase-2 follow-up.
